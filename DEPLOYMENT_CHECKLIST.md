# âœ… Railway Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before going live with your Movie List app on Railway.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] All recent changes are committed
- [ ] Local development server works correctly
- [ ] Database migrations are up to date locally
- [ ] No linting errors (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Production build succeeds locally (`pnpm build`)

## Railway Setup

### 1. Project Creation

- [ ] Created Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Connected Railway to GitHub account
- [ ] Created new Railway project
- [ ] Selected correct GitHub repository

### 2. Database Configuration

- [ ] Added PostgreSQL database to Railway project
- [ ] Verified `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is auto-created
- [ ] Database is showing as "Active" (green status)

### 3. Environment Variables

- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters, random)
  - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Optionally set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for CORS
- [ ] Verified all variables are saved

### 4. Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Confirmed Railway detected Dockerfile
- [ ] Set custom start command: `sh -c "pnpm prisma migrate deploy && node .output/server/index.mjs"`
- [ ] Verified build completed successfully
- [ ] App deployed successfully (green status)

### 5. Database Migrations

- [ ] Migrations ran automatically via start command, OR
- [ ] Ran migrations manually: `pnpm prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Verified migrations completed without errors

## Post-Deployment Testing

### 6. Application Health

- [ ] App is accessible at Railway-provided URL
- [ ] Health check endpoint works: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs
- [ ] App responds within reasonable time

### 7. Authentication Testing

- [ ] Can access login page
- [ ] Can create new user account
- [ ] Can log in with created account
- [ ] JWT cookies are set properly
- [ ] Can log out successfully
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### 8. Core Functionality

- [ ] Can add movies to collection
- [ ] Can view movie list
- [ ] Can update movie status
- [ ] Can reorder movies (drag and drop)
- [ ] Can delete movies
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly

### 9. Database Operations

- [ ] Data persists after page reload
- [ ] Multiple users can be created
- [ ] User data is isolated correctly
- [ ] No database connection errors in logs

## Optional Enhancements

### 10. Seeding (Optional)

- [ ] Decided whether to seed database with sample users
- [ ] If yes: Ran `pnpm db:seed` in Railway console
- [ ] If yes: Documented default credentials for team
- [ ] If yes: Planned to change/remove default passwords

### 11. Custom Domain (Optional)

- [ ] Purchased/have access to domain
- [ ] Added custom domain in Railway settings

- [ ] HTTPS certificate provisioned automatically
- [ ] Domain resolves correctly

### 12. Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] Reviewed Railway metrics (CPU, Memory)
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Configured alerts (if available)
- [ ] Optionally integrated external monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

## Security Checklist

### 13. Security Best Practices

- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong and unique (not default value)
- [ ] Environment variables contain no hardcoded secrets
- [ ] `.env` files are not committed to git
- [ ] Database is not publicly accessible
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic with Railway)
- [ ] CORS is configured if needed
- [ ] Rate limiting is in place (check `server/middleware/security.ts`)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] User passwords are hashed (bcrypt)

### 14. Default Credentials

- [ ] Changed all default passwords if using seed data
- [ ] Removed or documented seed users
- [ ] Created production admin account with strong password
- [ ] Documented credential management process

## Final Steps

### 15. Documentation

- [ ] Updated README with production URL (if sharing)
- [ ] Documented environment variables for team
- [ ] Shared deployment guide with team members
- [ ] Added deployment notes to project documentation

### 16. Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Enabled automated backups in Railway (Settings â†’ Database)
- [ ] Tested database backup/restore process
- [ ] Documented recovery procedures
- [ ] Scheduled regular backup verification

### 17. Performance

- [ ] Verified app loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Checked mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Tested on multiple browsers
- [ ] Verified no console errors in browser
- [ ] Monitored Railway metrics for resource usage

### 18. Go Live!

- [ ] Monitored logs for first few hours
- [ ] Collected initial feedback
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment for future updates

## Troubleshooting

If something isn't working:

1. âœ… Check Railway deployment logs
2. âœ… Verify all environment variables are set
3. âœ… Confirm database is running and connected
4. âœ… Check health endpoint responds
5. âœ… Review browser console for errors
6. âœ… Verify migrations ran successfully
7. âœ… Restart the service if needed
