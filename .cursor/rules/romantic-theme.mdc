# 💕 Romantic Theme Rules

This project is a gift of love. Every design decision, color choice, and word should reflect warmth, affection, and care.

## Design Principles

### 1. Color Usage

- **Primary Colors**: Use `love-rose`, `love-blush`, `love-lavender` from the romantic palette
- **Backgrounds**: Use `romantic-canvas`, `romantic-cream`, or `bg-romantic-gradient`
- **Accents**: Gold (`love-gold`) for special moments, coral (`love-coral`) for energy
- **Avoid**: Harsh reds, cold blues, stark blacks (except twilight mode)

### 2. Language & Copy

Always use warm, loving language:

❌ **Technical/Cold** → ✅ **Loving/Warm**

- "Delete" → "Remove Gently"
- "Error" → "Oops! Let's try that again together"
- "Success" → "Added with love! ❤️"
- "Want to Watch" → "Movies We'll Love" or "Dreaming"
- "Watching" → "Watching Together"
- "Watched" → "Our Favorites" or "Cherished"
- "On Hold" → "Taking a Break" or "Paused"
- "Dropped" → "Not For Us"
- "User" → Person's name or "my love"
- "List" → "Collection"
- "App" → "Our Collection"

### 3. Emojis & Icons

Use emojis generously to add warmth:

- Hearts: ❤️ 💕 💖 💗 💝 💓
- Sparkles: ✨ ⭐ 🌟 💫
- Love: 💑 👫 💏
- Special: 🎬 🎥 🍿 🎭

### 4. Components

#### Buttons

- Use `btn-primary` for main actions (rose gradient)
- Use `btn-secondary` for supporting actions (blush/peach)
- Add gentle hover effects with lift and glow

#### Cards

- Always use `card-hover` for interactive cards
- Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl` (softer than `rounded-lg`)
- Soft shadows with pink/rose tints

#### Inputs

- Use the `.input` class with romantic focus states
- Placeholders should be inviting: "Find something special..."
- Labels can include emojis

#### Modals & Dialogs

- Titles should be warm and reassuring
- Confirm buttons: "Yes, please" instead of "OK"
- Cancel buttons: "Not now" or "Maybe later"

### 5. Animations

Prefer gentle, flowing animations:

- `animate-float` for decorative elements
- `animate-heartbeat` for favorites/likes
- `animate-pulse-soft` for subtle emphasis
- `animate-glow` for special moments
- Avoid harsh, jarring transitions

### 6. Typography

- Headings: Use gradient text when appropriate (`text-romantic-gradient`)
- Body: Comfortable, easy-to-read
- Emphasis: Colored text (`text-love-rose`) over bold when possible

### 7. Spacing & Layout

- Generous spacing (more breathing room)
- Soft edges and rounded corners
- Warm negative space

### 8. Status & States

Status colors have special meaning:

- `status-dreaming` (Lavender): Movies you dream of watching together
- `status-watching-together` (Rose): Currently enjoying
- `status-cherished` (Gold): Treasured favorites
- `status-paused` (Peach): Taking a break
- `status-not-for-us` (Deep Rose): Moving on gracefully

### 9. Success Messages

All success messages should feel celebratory:

- "Added with love! ❤️"
- "Updated beautifully! ✨"
- "Removed gently 💫"
- "Saved to our collection! 💕"

### 10. Error Messages

Errors should be gentle and supportive:

- "Oops! Let's try that again together"
- "Something didn't work. Want to try once more? 💫"
- "Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Let's fix it together"

### 11. Loading States

Loading messages should be anticipatory:

- "Finding something special for us..."
- "Preparing our favorites..."
- "Getting everything ready..."
- "Just a moment, my love..."

### 12. Empty States

Empty states should be inviting:

- "Let's start our collection together 💑"
- "Nothing here yet. Ready to add our first movie? 💕"
- "Our journey begins here ✨"
